## Setting Up Git on Your Computer

On Windows, you can download the "Git for Windows" package from here:
https://git-for-windows.github.io/

## Configuring Git
A couple of very basic configurations should be made before you get started.

``` git config --global user.name “John Doe” ```

 ``` git config --global user.email “john@doe.org”```
 
 
 
 Let‘s start with an existing project that is not yet under version control. Change
into the project‘s root folder on the command line and use the “git init”

``` git init ```

### Getting an Overview of Your Changes

To get an overview of what you‘ve
changed since your last commit, you simply use the “git status” command:

```git status```

### Making Your First Commit
Simply execute the following commands:

 ``` git add .  ```
 
 ```git commit -m “Initial commit”```
 
 ### Inspecting the Commit History
 The “git log” command is used to display the project‘s commit history:
 
  ```git log```
